## I will always be a student of technology, people and our ever-changing world we all live in. 

My profession has been in the building automation sector for over 14 years. Initially starting as a commissioning engineer, then as a field-based engineer, moving on to a more senior role within my team. 

Currently, I am a service delivery expert. I teach myself and work with our companies bleeding-edge technology solutions, from [Linux](https://www.linux.com/what-is-linux/)  based small servers to the best [IoT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_Things) (internet of things) has to offer. I work with my team to keep them up to date with the best ways to roll out our solutions. In turn, we enable our customers to intelligently control their buildings via our applications and third-party integrations.  

I enjoy studying past, present and future works so I can learn, enlighten and see trends of our future society. Political issues and social change is something that interests me most of all. My studies have led me to become a [group leader](https://libertarianparty.co.uk/our-people/) for the Libertarian Party UK. 

I believe that freely sharing and discussing ideas is fundamental to better our society.
